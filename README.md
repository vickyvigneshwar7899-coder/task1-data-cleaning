# Task 1 – Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Dataset: Medical Appointment No Shows  
Tool Used: Python (Pandas)

# Cleaning Steps Performed:
- Renamed columns to lowercase and standardized format.
- Removed duplicate rows.
- Converted 'scheduledday' and 'appointmentday' to datetime format.
- Standardized text in 'gender' and 'no_show' columns.
- Removed invalid age entries (e.g., negative values).
- Dropped unneeded columns: 'patientid' and 'appointmentid'.
- Exported the cleaned data to Excel format.


Task 1 – Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Dataset Used: Medical Appointment No Shows
Tools: Python and Pandas library

 What I Did:
For this task, I worked on cleaning a real-world healthcare dataset that had some common data issues. Here's a quick summary of the steps I followed:

Renamed all the column headers to lowercase and made them consistent by replacing spaces and special characters.

Removed any duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.

Converted both the ScheduledDay and AppointmentDay columns into proper date formats.

Cleaned and standardized the text values in the Gender and No-show columns for consistency.

Found and removed any rows where the age was negative (which shouldn't exist).

Dropped a couple of columns (PatientId and AppointmentID) that weren’t needed for analysis.

Finally, I saved the cleaned version of the dataset as an Excel file for future use.

## The final dataset is now neat, structured, and ready to be used for data analysis or modeling.
